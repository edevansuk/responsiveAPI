IMAGES
Create a responsive image method
 Eventially lazy load images in to save bandwidth and always
 have a fallback.

ARCHITECTURE
 May need to re-architec this to use the dependencyList. Could
 clean the code up: http://www.dustindiaz.com/scriptjs
 
PAGE TYPE ACTIONS
 As pages are likely to be grouped then create a seperate file
 for each each grouping,, or create a loader based on $script
 to avoid having to have a lot of inline code within each
 page. Particularly if it's often the same.
